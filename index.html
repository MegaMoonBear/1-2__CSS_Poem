    <p class="poem">
        Cats sleep, anywhere,<br>
        Any table, any chair<br>
        Top of piano, window-ledge,<br>
        In the middle, on the edge,<br>
        Open drawer, empty shoe,<br>
        Anybody's lap will do,<br>
        Fitted in a cardboard box,<br>
        In the cupboard, with your frocks-<br>
        Anywhere! They don't care!<br>
        Cats sleep anywhere.
    </p>
    <!--This poem whimsically shares about the sleeping habits of cats. It captures the author's love of animals, from when she wrote it in the 1920s.-->
